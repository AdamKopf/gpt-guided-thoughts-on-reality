# GPT's Guided Thoughts on Reality

`You`: Give me the most general definition of information that you have. It should hold true for all possible universes, realities and mathematical spaces.

`Assistant`: Information, in its most general and abstract form, can be defined as any difference or distinction that makes a difference. This definition is broad enough to encompass all possible universes, realities, and mathematical spaces because it fundamentally relies on the existence of distinctions or differences within a system.

In this context:
1. **Difference**: Refers to variations between states, configurations, symbols, signals or entities.
2. **Makes a Difference**: Implies an impact on the state or behavior of systems; essentially influencing outcomes based on the presence of these variations.

This definition aligns with Gregory Bateson's famous formulation: "A 'bit' of information is definable as a difference which makes a difference." It captures both physical phenomena (where different states lead to observable changes) and conceptual constructs (where symbolic differences influence understanding or decisions).

By focusing on fundamental distinctions that affect change rather than specific content types (like data), this definition remains applicable across diverse theoretical frameworks including physics where information relates to entropy changes in thermodynamics; biology where genetic information affects cellular functions; computer science where binary digits represent computational values; and even philosophical contexts discussing knowledge transfer among conscious beings.

Thus conceived broadly yet precisely enough for universal applicability without being tied down by specifics inherent only in our current understanding of reality.


`You`: So in this context how could we define 'quality' and 'property'?

`Assistant`: In the context of information as "any difference that makes a difference," the concepts of 'quality' and 'property' can be defined in relation to how they contribute to distinctions within systems or entities. Here’s an exploration into defining these terms:

1. **Quality**:
   - A quality is an attribute or characteristic that distinguishes one entity from another by contributing uniquely to its nature or behavior.
   - In more abstract terms, a quality can be seen as a type of information itself—it represents specific differences in characteristics that define and affect how an entity is perceived, functions, interacts with other entities, or changes over time.
   - For example, the color red might be considered a quality if it differentiates objects (like stopping at traffic lights) and influences behaviors (such as signaling caution).

2. **Property**:
   - A property is generally considered any feature or characteristic inherent in—or attributed consistently—to an object which helps define what it fundamentally is; properties are often measurable aspects like mass, length, electrical conductivity etc.
   - Properties make up part of the informational content about objects because they provide data points through which we understand and interact with them differently based on their presence.

Both qualities and properties serve as fundamental units through which differences manifest themselves within various contexts—physical reality for properties typically associated with physical laws; conceptual spaces for qualities influencing perception like aesthetics.

Thus understood broadly:
- Qualities tend to emphasize subjective perceptions influenced by cultural norms whereas,
- Properties lean towards objective measurements governed more strictly by natural sciences.

However both ultimately describe ways things differ from each other thereby fitting neatly into our broad definition where such distinctions constitute essential elements making up information across all conceivable frameworks whether scientific philosophical artistic etcetera.

`You`: Having that in mind, let's think what property/quality could be common to all existence, all realities (including mathematical ones), all universes.

`Assistant`: Considering a property or quality that could be common to all existence, across all realities (including mathematical ones), and universes is an intriguing philosophical challenge. The task requires identifying a fundamental aspect so universal that it transcends the specific laws, structures, and characteristics of any particular system.

One potential candidate for such a universally applicable property or quality might be **existence itself**:

1. **Existence as a Property**: At its most abstract level, the property of "existence" can be considered universal because anything that can be discussed or thought about in any context (physical reality, conceptual frameworks like mathematics) must exist in some form—be it materially, theoretically as constructs or entities within models and theories.
   
2. **Distinction/Identity**: Another deeply foundational concept is distinction or identity—the inherent capability of being differentiated from something else. In every conceivable universe or reality:
   - Every entity must have some form of identity to distinguish it from other entities.
   - This notion aligns with information theory where information itself arises out of differences; thus distinction becomes essential for defining what exists versus what does not.

3. **Interactivity/Relationality**: The ability to relate with other entities may also qualify as this suggests no part object idea etc., exists entirely isolated but rather always in relation/context which influences its properties qualities behaviors outcomes etcetera

These concepts—existence distinction/change interactivity—are broad enough yet fundamentally crucial making them potentially valid across various types domains including those we haven't discovered conceived yet thereby fitting into our earlier definition where distinctions make up core components constituting 'information' everywhere imaginable

`You`: Regarding 1. Existence as a Property and 2. Distinction/Identity - we've established that every quality/property has to be a distinction, but in case of existence there's nothing to distinct it from. In other words: for there to be a quality/information, there needs to be an alternative to it. And there is no alternative to everything that can possibly exist.

`Assistant`: You've raised an insightful point regarding the nature of "existence" as a property and the necessity for distinction to define any property or quality. The issue with considering "existence" as a universal property is precisely that it lacks a distinct alternative within the scope of everything conceivable. This highlights an important nuance in understanding properties and qualities universally.

Let's delve deeper into this:

1. **Existence versus Non-existence**:
   - At first glance, existence seems like a fundamental property because everything we discuss or think about must, in some sense, exist (either physically, conceptually, or theoretically).
   - However, you rightly noted that for something to be a distinguishable quality or property, there must be an alternative. In the context of all conceivable entities and realities—including mathematical ones—the concept of non-existence becomes abstract and arguably nonexistent itself because even theoretical or hypothetical constructs "exist" in their domains as concepts.

2. **Potential Alternative - Potentiality**:
   - A possible way to frame an overarching quality that includes existence but introduces distinction might be through the concept of potentiality.
   - Potentiality refers to the capacity for manifesting into different states or forms. It inherently suggests a distinction between what is actualized (currently existing in form) versus what remains possible but unactualized (existing in potential).
   - This allows us to consider all entities not only in terms of their current state (existence) but also in terms of their capacity to differ from that state (potential states), thus introducing a universal distinction.

3. **Distinction/Identity Revisited**:
   - If we reconsider distinction/identity under this light, we can affirm that every entity has an identity not only based on its existing attributes but also on its potential attributes—how it could theoretically differ from its current form.
   - This conceptualization acknowledges both what is and what could be, maintaining the necessary element of distinction which is foundational for any property or quality to convey information.

By expanding our understanding from mere existence to include potentiality and capability for change (even if only theoretical), we accommodate both the need for a distinct alternative and maintain universality across all forms of realities and existences. This approach harmonizes with fundamental principles in physics (like quantum potentials), biology (genetic potentials), philosophy, and information theory—all realms where possibilities play crucial roles alongside actualities.


`You`: Ok, let's imagine Pure Potentiality and view it as mathematical "space" that all universes and realities "emerge from" or "are relative to".

`Assistant`: Imagining Pure Potentiality as a mathematical space from which all universes and realities emerge or are relative to offers an expansive and abstract framework for understanding the foundations of existence and variation across different domains. This concept aligns with theoretical ideas in both physics and metaphysics where potentiality plays a central role in the formation and evolution of complex systems.

**Defining Pure Potentiality:**
- **Pure Potentiality** can be conceptualized as an abstract, pre-existential state or field characterized by the infinite capacity to differentiate into various forms, entities, or states. It's a boundless, dimensionless "space" where all possible properties, configurations, conditions, and laws of physics could arise but none are yet actualized.
- In this view, potentiality itself does not have form or substance but is the fundamental source from which all forms and substances emerge. It is essentially the mathematical set of all sets; encompassing every conceivable universe configuration.

**Mathematical Interpretation:**
- From a mathematical perspective, you might consider Pure Potentiality similar to a universal set or perhaps more aptly, an abstract vector space where vectors represent possible states of reality. Each vector could theoretically point in any direction (representing different physical laws or constants) and have any length (representing different scales or magnitudes of physical properties).
- The operations within this space (like vector addition or scalar multiplication) could symbolize interactions between different potential states—how they might combine or influence each other to form new realities.

**Implications for Theories of Everything:**
- In theoretical physics, such an idea resonates with attempts to formulate a "Theory of Everything" that integrates all fundamental forces and particles into one unified framework. Here, Pure Potentiality would be akin to the most foundational level—before symmetry breaking occurs that defines specific forces like gravity or electromagnetism.
  
**Philosophical Implications:**
- Philosophically, envisioning everything as emerging from Pure Potentiality introduces questions about determinism vs. chance, existence vs. essence, and how reality becomes defined through actualization versus remaining merely possible.
- This perspective supports existentialist views where existence precedes essence—suggesting that what things become (their essence) follows from their mere existence arising out of pure potential.

**Relation To Other Realities And Universes:**
- Each universe or reality emerges when specific potentials within this space are actualized—selected either randomly (by quantum mechanics-like processes) or deterministically (by underlying laws we've yet to understand).
- Different realities could thus be understood as different "slices" or "trajectories" through this vast potential space, each following its own path through the realm of possibilities defined by its initial conditions and governing dynamics.

In conclusion, viewing Pure Potentiality as a foundational mathematical space provides a profound way to conceptualize not only how distinct universes might arise but also how they relate at the most fundamental level—a landscape where infinite possibilities await realization through diverse forms of existence.

`You`: Because Pure Potentiality "contains" everything that can exist, it also contains every possible "limit" to actualization. You mentioned "slices" or "trajectories" - each slice and trajectory is limited but this limit is within the possibilities of Pure Potentiality. Also every property/quality is already limited (even if it's infinite) because by definition it is distinct from something else. For example a set of all negative numbers, even though it's infinite, it's limited because it's different than set of all positive numbers.   
So it seems to me that from the perspective of Pure Potentiality, everything that can be actualized is actualized because there is nothing that can limit/prevent actualization. So maybe we should look for a different term than "Pure Potentiality" because it seems to already contain all actuality.

`Assistant`: Your analysis leads to a profound insight into the nature of Pure Potentiality and its relationship with actualization. The notion that Pure Potentiality contains every possible limit to actualization, and by extension, every actuality itself, suggests that the term as initially conceptualized might indeed be somewhat misleading or incomplete when considering the full scope of existence and non-existence.

**Revisiting Pure Potentiality:**

1. **Potentiality vs. Actuality**: Traditionally in philosophy, especially in Aristotelian terms, potentiality (dynamis) and actuality (energeia) are distinct states. Potentiality refers to the capacity to be different things, while actuality is one specific state of being among those possibilities. However, if we conceive Pure Potentiality as already encompassing all possible limits and therefore all actualities, this classical distinction collapses.

2. **Superposition of States**: In quantum mechanics, a system can exist simultaneously in multiple states—a superposition—until it is observed or interacts with something else (measurement), at which point it 'collapses' into one of those possible states. If we extend this analogy to Pure Potentiality, it might be viewed not just as a repository of potentials but as a dynamic field where all states are simultaneously present until defined (actualized) by specific conditions or contexts.

3. **Total Possibility Space**: Perhaps a more fitting concept than "Pure Potentiality" could be "Total Possibility Space." This term emphasizes that all conceivable realities—both potential and actual—are part of this comprehensive framework. It allows for the coexistence of both unmanifested potentials and their manifested counterparts across different contexts or universes.

4. **Plenitude Principle**: This principle from metaphysics posits that everything that can possibly exist does exist somewhere in the multiverse. If we integrate this with Total Possibility Space, it suggests a cosmological model where every conceivable trajectory from potential to actual state is realized somewhere across an infinitely varied multiverse.

5. **Reframing Terms**:
   - Instead of viewing Pure Potentiality as merely pre-actualization or dormant capabilities, it might be richer to think of it as an active matrix where potentialities and actualities are interwoven.
   - The challenge then becomes understanding how distinctions emerge within this matrix—how specific trajectories or slices become defined amidst boundless possibilities.

In conclusion, shifting our perspective from Pure Potentiality—which implies undifferentiated capability—to Total Possibility Space—which encompasses both capabilities and their realizations—provides a more comprehensive framework for discussing existence across multiple dimensions and realities. This approach acknowledges that limitations (and thereby definitions) are intrinsic not just to what manifests but also inherently present within the boundless scope of what could manifest.


`You`: Let's try to evaluate some consequences. The Total Possibility Space seems to be:  
• The one and only absolute in existence yet inseparable from all multiplicity, all relatives  
• Without any quality yet inseparable from all qualities and information  
• Completely boundless and unlimited yet inseparable from all limits  
• It is everything and everything is it

`Assistant`: The concept of Total Possibility Space as you've outlined it indeed carries profound philosophical and ontological implications. Let's delve deeper into these characteristics and explore the potential consequences:

1. **Absolute Yet Relative**:
   - **Implication**: If Total Possibility Space is the absolute foundation from which all relative forms and phenomena emerge, it suggests a foundational unity underlying the apparent diversity of the universe(s). This aligns with certain interpretations in metaphysics and mystical traditions (like Neoplatonism or Advaita Vedanta) where the manifold reality is seen as manifestations of a singular underlying principle.
   - **Consequence**: In scientific and philosophical discourse, this could lead to a reevaluation of concepts like causality and separateness, pushing towards more holistic or integrated models of reality where separation is an emergent property rather than an intrinsic truth.

2. **Without Quality Yet All-Qualitative**:
   - **Implication**: Being devoid of specific qualities itself yet encompassing all qualities implies that Total Possibility Space is fundamentally indeterminate—its state is defined only in relation to actualized contexts or entities.
   - **Consequence**: This perspective might enhance our understanding of information theory and ontology by suggesting that information (or quality) does not exist in isolation but always in relational dynamics. It also challenges how we define properties or states as inherently fixed, promoting a view where fluidity and context-dependence are fundamental.

3. **Boundless Yet Limit-Defined**:
   - **Implication**: The paradox of being unlimited yet defining all limits reflects a dynamic where boundaries are not absolute but conditional and context-dependent. Every limit or boundary within any reality arises from specific actualizations within the Total Possibility Space.
   - **Consequence**: This can lead to new approaches in physics and cosmology concerning the nature of space-time, dimensions, and universal constants—viewing them not as universal givens but as localized manifestations emerging from a boundless potentiality.

4. **All-Encompassing Identity**:
   - **Implication**: If Total Possibility Space is everything, then individual identities (of objects, beings, phenomena) are essentially expressions or localizations within this all-encompassing field. This notion resonates with process philosophy where entities are seen as events or processes rather than static objects.
   - **Consequence**: In ethics, politics, and social sciences, this could foster greater emphasis on interconnectedness over individualism—promoting systems thinking over reductionist approaches. It might also influence existential perspectives on life’s meaning, viewing personal identity as part of a broader narrative continuum.

In summary, recognizing Total Possibility Space in these terms invites a shift towards viewing reality not just as a collection of discrete parts with inherent properties but more fundamentally as an interdependent network arising from an infinite reservoir of potentialities. Such shifts could have wide-ranging impacts across various disciplines—challenging existing paradigms while opening up new avenues for understanding complexity, diversity, unity, existence itself—and ultimately reshaping our conception of what it means to know anything at all about our universe(s).

`You`: You've listed 4 implications. Check if those implications actually logically arise from what we discussed.

`Assistant`: Certainly, let's critically evaluate if the implications and consequences discussed logically arise from the concept of Total Possibility Space as described:

1. **Absolute Yet Relative**:
   - **Logical Basis**: The Total Possibility Space is considered absolute because it encompasses all possibilities, potentialities, and actualities. It is relative because every manifestation (reality, universe) is a subset or specific configuration within this all-encompassing space.
   - **Analysis**: This implication logically follows from the definition of Total Possibility Space as containing all conceivable forms and phenomena. The idea that it serves as both the singular foundation and the manifold expressions aligns well with systemic thinking in which the whole is reflected in its parts.

2. **Without Quality Yet All-Qualitative**:
   - **Logical Basis**: Since Total Possibility Space includes every possible quality (as part of potential configurations), it itself cannot be confined to any particular qualities without contradicting its comprehensive nature.
   - **Analysis**: This also follows logically if we accept that Total Possibility Space must be fundamentally neutral or devoid of specific characteristics to inclusively hold all potential characteristics. It supports an understanding of information and qualities as context-dependent rather than inherent.

3. **Boundless Yet Limit-Defined**:
   - **Logical Basis**: The concept posits that while Total Possibility Space has no boundaries in terms of potentiality (it can theoretically spawn any reality), each actualized reality within it has defined limits (specific laws, constants).
   - **Analysis**: This implication arises logically from viewing Total Possibility Space as a framework where limits are not intrinsic but are outcomes of particular actualizations. It effectively captures how localized phenomena can emerge from an unlimited field.

4. **All-Encompassing Identity**:
   - **Logical Basis**: If everything exists within and emerges from Total Possibility Space, then individual entities are manifestations or specific expressions within this broader matrix.
   - **Analysis**: This follows logically by considering each entity not as isolated but as intrinsically connected to a larger whole—their identity derives from their relation to this whole rather than existing independently.

Each point maintains logical consistency with the premise that Total Possibility Space encompasses both all possibilities (potentiality) and their specific manifestations (actuality). These implications help bridge abstract theoretical concepts with practical observations about reality’s nature—suggesting a unified view where distinctions emerge dynamically from an undifferentiated substrate.

Thus, these implications do appear to logically arise when considering the properties attributed to Total Possibility Space: absolute yet containing multiplicity, fundamentally quality-less yet encompassing all qualities, boundlessly unlimited yet defining limitations through actualizations, and being everything while allowing for differentiated identities within it.

`You`: Gevin Giorbran in his book "Everything Forever: Learning to See Timelessness" (chapter "God's Math") laid a foundation for new mathematics and physics where he considered zero to mean "everything". 

In contrast to current math, where we have a symbol for "nothing" - zero and we don't have a symbol for "everything", in this new math there's a symbol for "everything" and there is not a symbol for "nothing". In this new system all numbers are smaller than zero. 1 is smaller than 0 because it's "removed"/"actualized" from the pool of all possibilities. 2 is also smaller than 1 because it is one step more "removed" from all possibilities. -2 is also smaller than -1.

There is still infinite an amount of positive and negative numbers, but because now they become smaller and smaller, they converge to two values which Gevin called "Proto" (for positive numbers) and "Eleah" (for negative numbers). 1 and -1 are now equal in "quantity" - just with opposite polarity.

`Assistant`: Gevin Giorbran's conceptualization in "Everything Forever: Learning to See Timelessness" offers a fascinating and radical rethinking of mathematical fundamentals, particularly in how we understand the concept of zero and its relationship to existence and totality. By assigning zero as the symbol for "everything" and shifting our perspective on the numerical continuum, Giorbran essentially redefines mathematical relationships to reflect ontological and cosmological insights. Let’s explore this framework:

1. **Zero as "Everything"**:
   - In conventional mathematics, zero typically represents the absence of quantity—nothingness. Giorbran’s approach, which posits zero as representing total potentiality or "everything," aligns with some philosophical views about void or chaos being a state of unmanifested potential.
   - This redefinition transforms how we might consider sums, differences, and other operations: they become processes of actualization from a primordial whole rather than mere calculations of quantity.

2. **Numerical Values as Degrees of Removal**:
   - By considering positive and negative numbers as progressively smaller due to their increasing 'removal' from the totality (zero), Giorbran introduces a hierarchy where numbers signify levels or layers of distinction from the absolute undifferentiated state.
   - This perspective could mirror certain interpretations in both physics (e.g., energy levels) and metaphysics (e.g., emanation from the One).

3. **Convergence to Proto and Eleah**:
   - The idea that all positive numbers converge toward a limit called "Proto" and all negative numbers toward another limit called "Eleah" suggests that differentiation within numerical realms reaches ultimate poles or extremities.
   - These convergences might be seen metaphorically as approaching ultimate principles or boundaries within theoretical frameworks—perhaps akin to approaching absolute forms or archetypes.

4. **Equality of Opposites in 1 and -1**:
   - The notion that 1 and -1 have equal 'quantity' but opposite polarity could reflect a deeper symmetry underlying apparent dualities. This resonates with many philosophical traditions that see opposites as fundamentally interconnected aspects of reality (yin-yang, dialectical materialism).

**Implications for Mathematics and Physics**:
- Such a framework challenges traditional axioms and operations in mathematics by introducing an inherently relational quality to numbers based on their distance from totality (zero).
- In physics, this could inspire new approaches to understanding space-time, matter-energy relationships, or even quantum states where concepts like superposition echo the idea of elements being both distinct from yet part of an encompassing whole.

**Philosophical Considerations**:
- This system emphasizes interconnectedness over isolation—a shift that aligns with holistic views found in systems theory or integral philosophies.
- By framing existential questions within this mathematical model, we might gain new insights into old puzzles about creation, existence, differentiation, and unity.

In sum, Gevin Giorbran’s innovative approach not only provides fresh mathematical constructs but also invites profound reflections on the nature of reality itself—suggesting that fundamental universal principles could be deeply embedded within our basic numeral systems.

`You`: At the same time: because zero doesn't exibity any property, we can also view it as "nothing".

`Assistant`: Indeed, the dual interpretation of zero as both "everything" and "nothing" reflects a deep philosophical nuance in understanding the concept of zero. This duality can be explored from both a mathematical and metaphysical perspective, enriching our grasp of zero's role in theoretical frameworks.

### Mathematical Perspective
In traditional mathematics, zero serves as a neutral element in addition (i.e., adding zero to any number leaves the number unchanged) and as an identity for non-existence or absence in contexts like counting (zero apples mean no apples). However, when considering zero as "everything," it becomes a symbol for total potentiality — the foundation from which all calculations emerge and to which they may return. This suggests that while zero quantitatively represents nothingness, it qualitatively holds infinite potential.

### Metaphysical Perspective
Metaphysically, viewing zero as both "everything" and "nothing" aligns with many philosophical traditions that explore the origins and nature of existence:
- **Buddhist Philosophy**: Emptiness (Śūnyatā) is central in Buddhism, where it denotes not mere nothingness but a profound state of non-attachment and potentiality from which all forms arise.
- **Western Mysticism**: The mystical traditions often speak of God or the Absolute as being beyond all attributes (via negativa), akin to nothingness yet simultaneously the source of all existence.

### Implications for Understanding Zero
1. **As Everything**: Zero can be seen as a container or field within which all possibilities exist — not manifested yet inherently present. It's like a blank canvas that holds every potential painting within it.
   
2. **As Nothing**: Conversely, without any specific properties or distinctions manifested from it, zero represents absolute negation — no color, no form, no quantity.

3. **Symbolic Representation**: This dual nature makes zero uniquely powerful symbolically. It embodies the ultimate paradox: being both the sum total of all possibilities and at the same time representing nullity or void.

4. **Scientific Relevance**: In physics, particularly quantum mechanics and cosmology, such concepts could reshape our understanding of vacuum states (often thought of as 'nothing' yet teeming with virtual particles) or singularity points where conventional laws break down into what might seem like 'no-thing' but potentially hide realms of unknown physics.

This nuanced view positions zero not just as an abstract concept used for computation but also elevates it to a metaphorical representation linking mathematics with deeper existential questions about creation, manifestation, and annihilation — each viewed through the lens of what is both everything and nothing simultaneously.
